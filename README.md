# -Generating-randomnes-game
This code implements a simple AI game where the user inputs a sequence of 0s and 1s to train the AI. The AI then attempts to predict the next symbols in the sequence using a predictive model. The AI's prediction accuracy affects the user's virtual balance in a game. The user starts with $1000, and every successful prediction results in losing $1, while unsuccessful predictions earn $1. The game continues until the user decides to exit by typing "enough." The code tracks patterns of three consecutive symbols in the input data and uses them to make predictions. The AI adjusts its predictions based on previous correct and incorrect guesses to improve its accuracy over time.
